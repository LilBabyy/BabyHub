Q: Why am I getting this error when starting BabyHub? "Found a disallowed program running on machice, please disable [Custom Launcher] and reconnect.

A: It could be because of an anti-virus program. Disable any anti-virus and re-install BabyHub.

Q: Game stuck on "Logging In.." or asks me for email and password.

A: Make sure you have "Node" and "Net" installed. Located in "Required Files To Run Server" folder.

Q: How come my anti-virus is saying BabyHub is a virus? 

A: We have to ensure that we redirect all fortnite servers to ensure you don't get banned. So its a false positive virus.

Q: Can you get banned? 

A: No, you can't, this isn't linked to Epic Games or their servers at all.

Q: How come when I press the play button, it doesn't put me in a match?

A: We do not support users to go into a match, you can only view the cosmetics.

Q: Why hasn't the new cosmetics updated yet?

A: Either wait for me to update the server or make a new profile with a different username.
